# Korean/Japanese L1 Interference Patterns in English

## Article Errors

Korean and Japanese have no articles. Common errors:

| Wrong | Right | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| "I fixed bug" | "I fixed a bug" | Singular countable, first mention → a/an |
| "The bug was in function" | "The bug was in the function" | Specific reference → the |
| "I updated codes" | "I updated the code" | Mass noun, no plural |
| "Please check below link" | "Please check the link below" | Demonstrative position |

## Preposition After Verb

| Wrong | Right |
|---|---|
| "discuss about" | "discuss" |
| "explain about" | "explain" |
| "approach to the problem" | "approach the problem" |
| "access to the API" (verb) | "access the API" |
| "reply the message" | "reply to the message" |
| "request to fix" | "request a fix" |

## Connector Over-use

Korean has explicit connectors for every logical relation. English often uses simpler ones:

| Wrong | Right |
|---|---|
| "Also additionally, furthermore..." | "Also..." (one connector) |
| "Therefore, thus, as a result..." | "So..." or "This means..." |
| "However but..." | "But..." or "However..." |

## Politeness Hedging

Korean politeness bleeds into English as excessive hedging:

| Too hedged | Natural |
|---|---|
| "I was wondering if maybe it might be possible to..." | "Could we..." |
| "I think perhaps this might possibly cause..." | "This might cause..." |
| "If it is not too much trouble, could you please..." | "Could you..." |

## Subject Repetition

| Wrong | Right |
|---|---|
| "The function, it processes the request and it returns" | "The function processes the request and returns" |

## Passive Voice Over-use

| Over-used passive | Active |
|---|---|
| "The issue was found by me" | "I found the issue" |
| "It was decided to refactor..." | "We decided to refactor..." |
| "The tests were run by the CI" | "CI ran the tests" |

Exception: passive is correct when the actor is unknown or irrelevant.

## Korean-Specific Patterns

| Pattern | Example | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Sentence-final "I think" from ~것 같다 | "This is a bug I think" | "I think this is a bug" or just "This looks like a bug" |
| Double negative from Korean emphasis | "It's not that it doesn't work" | "It partially works" or state directly |
| Topic-first from Korean SOV | "This feature, we should remove" | "We should remove this feature" |
| Overly long sentences | 3+ clauses joined by "and" | Split into 2-3 sentences |
